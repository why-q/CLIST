## Introduction

A tiny project on a whim, using ChatGPT-4.0 to complete over **80%** of the code without any front-end or Flask knowledge on my part. The project creates a web page that saves URLs to various websites you want to view but haven't seen yet to a backend database and displays them in a list on the page.

Features: 
- Support for automatically fetching URL title.
- Support for deleting added URLs.
- Data is stored continously.

## Usage

This project was tested with Python=3.12. Make sure the correct version of Python is installed and run it with the following instructions:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
